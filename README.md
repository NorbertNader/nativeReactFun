# nativeReactFun

this will be exciting!

in the directry run
`react-native start`
and then the emulator be it iOS `react-native run-ios` or android `react-native run-android`

***

Very annoying when doing apk release...

before running

`./gradlew assembleRelease`

remember to `unlink node_modules/react-native/third-party/glog-0.3.4/test-driver`

***

don't forget to run the emulator...

lets see what we have here...

`emulator -list-avds`

ok lets try this one...

`emulator -avd Nexus_6_API_25`

delicious.
